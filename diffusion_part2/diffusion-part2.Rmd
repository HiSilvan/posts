Since I was recently researching different diffussion models I thought it would be nice to see whether they are applicable to popularity of information researched online.

I could choose any topic but I instantly remembered time when Candy Crash Saga was very popular in Poland. I wondered whether it was similar in other countries.

For those not familiar with the topic. Candy Crush Saga is a mobile game based on connect-4 principle.

## Getting data from Google Trends

I used [gtrendsR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gtrendsR/index.html) package to retrieve relative number of searches of CCS over time.

Below is example how we can retrieve term popularity for given keyword and country:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, comment=""}
  
  library(gtrendsR)
  usr <- "user@gmail.com"
  psw <- "pwd"            
  gconnect(usr, psw)
  
  # "/m/0rytj3p" is a hashcode for CCS mobile game
  ccs_trend <- gtrends(query = "/m/0rytj3p", 
                         start_date = "2012-04-01",
                         geo = c("US", "PL"))

```

There are important notes that I need to make when it comes to retrieve data via this Google Trends API:

 - there is an user quota something about 500 requests a day
 - you can issue only 10 requests per minute
 - it is relative keyword popularity within country
 - requested data is always normalized to max = 100 (I kept US as a reference category)
 - if there is not enough data in any of the selected countries it will return error
 - if you want to use more complex search term like *CCS mobile game* you need to manually select it in Google Trends and copy the hash code of the term from embedding script - [details](https://support.google.com/trends/answer/4365538?hl=en)
 
I must admit overall this was more challenging than expected but as long as you keep all those limitations in mind everything should be fine. At the end of the day I ended up with weekly data from 61 countries.

Below I plotted randomly selected countries to see what different popularity patterns we can observe:

```{r, echo=FALSE, dpi=120, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, eval= TRUE}

  dta.plot <- ccs[country %in% c("US", "FR", "NL", "CA")]
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = popularity), data = dta.plot) + 
    geom_line(aes(colour = country)) + 
    theme_classic() + 
    ggtitle("Candy Crush Saga popularity", subtitle = "relative to US")
  
```

## Diffusion Theory

Diffusion theory explains how information expands through connected systems via three parameters:

 - **p - appeal of innovation**
 - **q - propensity to immitate**
 - **m - ultimate potential**

Specific models have different dependencies on those parameters or assume their heterogeneity in population under study. Here I will use *shifted Gompertz* distribution but other choices are possible (*Bass, Gamma Shifted Gompertz, Weibull*). 
Examples of the evolution curves based on SG distribution may be found [here](http://www.jakubglinka.com/2016-12-30-diffusion-part1/).

### Shifted Gompertz diffusion model

We assume that adoption of the app is following shifted Gompertz distribution with pdf:

$$f(t|b, \eta) = b e^{-bx}e^{-\eta e^{-bx}}[1 + \eta(1 - e^{-bx})], \ \ \ \mathrm{for} \ \ t \ge 0$$

where $p = be^{-\eta}$ and $q = b - p$.

Let $F$ denote cumulative density function of SG and since we have weekly aggregated data we will assume that $t$ is measured in weeks. Then term popularity in week $t$ is equal to:

$$ N_t = m * (F(t| b, \eta) - F(t - 1 | b, \eta)) $$

Usually diffusion models are estimated using non-linear least squares technique[^1] which is equivalent to

$$ S_t = m * (F(t| b, \eta) - F(t - 1 | b, \eta)) + \epsilon, \ \ \ \mathrm{where} \ \ \epsilon \sim \mathrm{N}[0, \sigma] $$

where $S_t$ denotes observed term popularity in week $t$.

Below is my Stan implementation of this model:

```{stan output.var="ex1", eval = FALSE}

data {
  int<lower = 2> T;                         // number of observed periods
  real<lower = 0> S[T];                     // share of users adoptions
}

parameters {
  real<lower=0> b;                          // appeal of innovation
  real<lower=0> eta;                        // rate of adoption
  real<lower=0> sigma;
  real<lower=0> m;
}

transformed parameters {
  vector[T] share;
  share = sg_weekly_share(T, m, b, eta);    // N_t
}

model {
      S ~ normal(share, sigma);
}

generated quantities {
  vector[T] pred_s;
  real p;
  real q;
  
  pred_s = share;
  p = b * exp(- eta);
  q = b - p;
}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, dpi=120, fig.height=4, fig.width=8,eval=TRUE,include=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

res <- lapply(countries, function(xx) {
  dta <- ccs[country == xx,]
  sg_diffusion(date = dta$week, x = dta$popularity)
})
names(res) <- countries

```

### Cross-country comparison

Below I plotted all the countries with respect to the $p$ and $q$. 
Size of the label is proportional to the log of keyword popularity $m$.

```{r, echo=FALSE, dpi=120, fig.height=4, fig.width=8,eval=TRUE}

  # plot p and q plus posteriors
  # annotate m as point size or just text
  get_res <- function(xx) {
    
    rr <- res[[xx]]
    s <- do.call(cbind, rstan::extract(rr$fit, pars = c("m", "p", "q")))
    s <- matrix(apply(s, 2, mean), nrow = 1)
    s <- as.data.frame(s)
    s$country <- names(res)[xx]
    s
  }
  tmp <- 1:length(res) %>% map(get_res) %>% do.call(rbind, .)
  names(tmp) <- c("m", "p", "q", "country")
  
  tmp$label <- "late majority"
  tmp[tmp$q > .07, ]$label <- "late boom"
  tmp[tmp$p > .001, ]$label <- "early adopters"
  
  ggplot(aes(x = p, y = q), data = tmp) + 
    theme_classic() +
    guides(size = FALSE) + 
    geom_label(aes(label = country, size = log(round(m / 1000)))) + 
    stat_ellipse(aes(colour = label), type = "norm", level = .7)


```

I grouped countries with respect to speed and dynamics of adoption. 
Below I plotted selected countries from the respective groups.
Red line is theoretical diffusion curve of fitted SG model. I plotted additionally 95% confidence interval.

### Early Adopters

```{r, echo=FALSE, dpi=120, fig.height=4, fig.width=8,eval=TRUE}

plot(res[["SE"]], "Candy Crush Saga searches: SE")

```

Sweden had highest $p$ parameter which means that it adopted CCS fastest along with Great Britain, Netherlands and Greece. 

### Late boom

```{r, echo=FALSE, dpi=120, fig.height=4, fig.width=8,eval=TRUE}

plot(res[["TW"]], "Candy Crush Saga searches: TW")

```

Taiwan had very steep adoption rate which according to this article exceeded makers expectations:  
<http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/business/2013/09/17/389125/Candy-Crushs.htm>  
Similar reports can be found for Hong Kong.

### Late Majority

```{r, echo=FALSE, dpi=120, fig.height=4, fig.width=8,eval=TRUE}

plot(res[["PL"]], "Candy Crush Saga searches: PL")

```

So in the end I was surprised to see that Poland was rather late adopter of CCS compared to other countries!

## Summary
